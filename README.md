# IB_modelling
This repository is created to show the modelling work I intend to complete for IB related tasks, such as LBOs, Comparable Companies Analysis, Sell-Side and Buy-Side M&A and the IPO process. It will also include modelling related to distressed debt investing such as 13-Week CF and waterfall models. Every information herein is derived from public sources. Any valutation should not be construed as investment advice since this is for demonstration purposes only.
